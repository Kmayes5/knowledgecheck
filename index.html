                 <h1>Hometown Ice Cream</h1>
                 <h2>Best homemade icecream made from the start of our kitchen.</h2> 
                 <p>The nostalgic hand cranking of ice cream on the back porch may be in for a revival. Chemical engineering certainly makes a decent store-bought ice cream, but nothing can beat the taste of making up our own.
                    Producing our own ice cream at home, made by customizing the flavorings and introducing ingredients that may not be available commercially, is a wonderful addiction.
